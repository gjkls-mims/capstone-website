## Gender Representation and Opinion Detection in the Media

Our capstone project is partnering with Berkeley-based nonprofit ReThink Media for the purpose of building them an NLP-powered product that aims to fourth their mission. They work to deliver workshops for nonprofits on media strategy and conduct in-depth analyses of media discourse. This work enables nonprofits and political campaigns to be more effective in their communication strategies. Past examples of work include analyzing the social media discourse about campaign finance reform and gauging the media reaction to the signing of the START nuclear treaty.

For our capstone project, we will build a dashboard to visualize how people are quoted and represented in the media and the output of an opinion detection model. ReThink Media plans to use this visualization to enable advocates in their issue areas (nuclear weapons issues and voting rights among others) to baseline and track media representation. We will follow a similar approach to Informed Opinion’s Gender Tracker. We will take this analysis further by adding new capabilities. From ReThink Media’s existing database and taxonomy of news articles, we plan to address the following questions with a set of NLP and ML techniques.
